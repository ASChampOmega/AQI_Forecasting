# AQI Forecasting

This github contains the code for my CS 480 Final Project

All the code here is arranged as notebooks that were downloaded from Kaggle.

The notebooks, and hence the associated models, are currently privated on Kaggle, but I can make those notebooks public immediately as required!
Please let me know if you would like to see or use any of the models by emailing me
