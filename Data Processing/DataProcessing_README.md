# Data Processing

There are 3 main data processing files: "Deep Engineering", "Tabular Engineering", and "Load satellite images"

1. "Tabular engineering file" processes the raw data into a large table. The code from AirDelhi was referenced and heavily adapted here to read the correct files and then convert it to a large pandas dataframe with several new features.
2. "Deep Engineering file" processes the large table into all the different formats as needed, including data imputation. It converts it into a regular dataset and also a extended testing dataset. The IDW model is implemented here for data imputation. Some code from Baselines is repeated just to streamline training, testing and prediction using IDW. There are additional functions here that were used to compute constants and values for other notebooks, such as the bounding box for the satellite images and so on.
3. "Load satellite images" has the code to download images. Images are first loaded, then the correct region is screenshotted automatically via Chromium, and then broken into smaller images manually. To ensure higher image quality, the overall area of interest is broken into many large images which are loaded from Esri. Then they are broken into smaller images in python and stored at the desired resolution. This is quite efficient and obtains all 900 satellite images fast. Downloading all exact areas is really slow, but downloading one large image is fast but has poor quality. This solution is in between!
